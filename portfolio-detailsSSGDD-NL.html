                    his name is Michael conners, he was a professional
                    mixed martial artist who just retired. He has a
                    family and is happy, but suddenly his family gets
                    kidnapped, and he must rescue them. But the
                    organization which captured them is a mysterious
                    one. Where he must use his power to protect his
                    family and rescue them from danger.
                    The story would continue like that as he tracks the
                    enemies down whilst locating multiple bases and
                    infiltrating them to gather information and access
                    to more facilities.
                    After finally tracking down his family he sees his
                    wife and daughter as they are about to be executed,
                    but there is only one enemy left. The head of the
                    organization himself. As a boss battle starts you
                    fight in the middle of a warehouse, jumping over
                    boxes, getting in positions, and getting into melee
                    combat with the final enemy.
                    After Defeating the final boss, you reunite with the

                Gauntlets also have various effects such as increased damage

            <h2>Inspiration 1: SuperHot</h2>
            <p>
              Quantum Vision and superhot
              are both great inspirations that I had when
              first thinking about the concept of this
              game. I like the slow-motion effects in both
              games and time distortion, but I decided to
              change it a bit and alter it. To instead
              show everyone a bit slower whilst also
              predicting their next path. This is
              something I have not seen a lot in games
              when researching to find other examples for
              my project but suddenly found out It was not
              done much. And thus, decided to make this
              concept of mine.

              But also, the spiderman
              games, it showed me what has already been
              done with this type of mechanic and I
              decided to use that as a reference and try
              to go into a different direction to try and
              locate a unique selling point. And I did
              find the answer after some brainstorming.
